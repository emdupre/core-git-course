**This course is based on materials by [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org)**

> ## Prerequisites
> In this lesson we use git from the Unix Shell.
> Some previous experience with the shell is expected,
> *but is not mandatory*.
>
> We expect participants to execute this content locally using their
> unix shell (either natively on Mac & Linux or under WSL on Windows).
>
> Alternatively, this course can be followed on Windows using
> Git Bash.
> All of the commands shown will work on Windows using Git Bash,
> with the exception of the `nano` command.
> nano is a common text editor on Linux:
> Windows users should use the `notepad` command instead, and set
> notepad as the core editor when configuring Git.
>
> You will need a GitHub account for this session.
> Please [sign up for an account](https://github.com/)
> if you do not already have one.
