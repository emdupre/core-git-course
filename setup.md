## Files

There are no files required for this lesson. You will create all the files needed.

## Software

git is free and open-source software, available for all major operating systems.

### Installation

If you are working on a Linux or MacOS machine,
[please see here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for git installation instructions.

For Windows machines, we **highly recommend** that you install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
WSL installation instructions are [available here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

GitHub does not require you to download any additional software;
however, you will need to make a GitHub account.
[Please see here](https://github.com/join) to create your account.

Although we will not cover them in this lesson, there are
GitHub desktop clients that you can download to provide a
graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with git and GitHub.

If you would like to use a desktop client, we recommend:

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
